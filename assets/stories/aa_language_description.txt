This is a description of the syntax for my body syntotic programming language.

Key words:

Characters:
 - introduce // Creates a specific character at the beginning of the current path. Or creates an adjacent path to the left or right.
   introduce [Optional: left/right] [Behavior: protagonist/companion adult[/child] 
   (Specify character type. Think Bone.) protagonist signals that this should be the character that the camera now follows.

   Introductions come before a path expression. The character will be placed on the path of on a neighhboring lane if left or right is specified.
   IDEA: Allow for character data initialization.

Paths:            
 - up  
 - arc

Operators:  // Each of these will eventually contain the ability to display a message and also manipulate the numerical value for the property.
            // The syntax \name should be replaced at runtime with the variable's name in the statistics field.

            // varname location_on_path [Condition] message [Condition] message
            // condition: <1 >0 =4, etc. // Different descriptive messages for different states.
 - narrate
 - think
 - good  
 - bad      // bad 10 Stale Potatoes -e Those potatoes were horrible. // Thinking with an option of expressing.
 - var

 - say

 
// -- A programmer should be able to set global values up front.

# Thinking.   // Each of these types could be subdivided further.
# Expressions.
# Narrations.

Conditionals:
