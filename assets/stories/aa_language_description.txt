This is a description of the syntax for my body syntotic programming language.

Key words:

Characters:
 - introduce // Creates a specific character at the beginning of the current path. Or creates an adjacent path to the left or right.
   introduce [Optional: left/right] [Optional: protagonist] adult[/child] 
   (Specify character type. Think Bone.) protagonist signals that this should be the character that the camera now follows.

   Introductions come before a path expression. The character will be placed on the path of on a neighhboring lane if left or right is specified.
   IDEA: Allow for character data initialization.

Paths:            
 - up  
 - arc

Operators:
 - narrate
 - food

Conditionals:
 - fork

story
