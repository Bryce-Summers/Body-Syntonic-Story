# Programming Guide

Please put all core functions inside other BSS namespace.

Generic classes that can be reused across projects are house in the EX namespace.

instead of "class foo", write class BSS.foo.


Most of the geometries that we will be using will be instantiated at the origin and will be controled through scales, rotations, and positioning.

Because of the grunt build include ordering, super classes need to be included in the html file before sub classes...


Use the Unit_Meshes class for allocating meshes.


My custom defined mesh classes will implement their own clone function.

# Rendering.

# Branches

This project will have several branches called i1, i2, i3, i[x], etc. that represent diffferent iterations for the project.

Here is what each of these iterations means:

i1: 


# GIT
To checkout a remote branch use:
git fetch
git checkout i[x]

# Grunt

run 'grunt' to include all of the files.
run 'grunt concat' to build a single file.



Models are assumed to point to other models, elements to other elements.
Elements glue stuff together, models are mainly in the realm of mathmatics.
